# Fractal Explorer
This script generates a Tkinter GUI to preview and render [Julia set](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/JuliaSet.html) fractals. Quadratic Julia sets are generated by the expression
$z_{n+1} = z_{n}^{2} +c$
where _c_ is a constant.
Sets whose value of _c_ lies within the [Mandlebrot set](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MandelbrotSet.html) remain connected and are called Fatou sets, and other values of _c_ form disconnected, interesting fractal patterns called Cantor sets or Fatou dust.
